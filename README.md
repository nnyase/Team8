6-week project at the Computer Vision Centre in Barcelona in which I collaborated with Master students to develop software tools for uploading art images, and automatically identifying, and matching the images to an art database.
Image preprocessing steps include automatic noise removal, orientation correction, and background removal.  
The system identifies and matches images based on similarities within images, optical character recognition (OCR), color, texture, and key-point descriptors.
Other tasks include image segmentation, image restoration, and enhancement using AI models (CNN and GANs)
